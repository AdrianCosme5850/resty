## Approach  

Functionalized all children components of app.js and added scss for all the components. The app still functions as it did originally.  

## Lab 27  

## Approach  

Changed all uses of class based state to use the hook useState. Also made the form actually take in a url, and display it afterwards. Wrote a test that can confirm this.

## Lab 28  

Added a useEffect hook that triggers every time a change is made to the request parameter state. This hook requests the url, and sets the state of the data. Also prettified the json.
